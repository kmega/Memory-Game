Memory Game Project by Charles Szelazek.

About the game.

- This project was made as one of the challanges required to pass at Front-End Developer Nanodegree Course. Current state of the project is final. Game requires nothing more, but working internet browser (for example: Google Chrome) with internet access (see below: Dependencies).

How to play.

- There are 16 cards with 2 x 8 symbols (each card appears twice in deck). To win one must match all cards with their symbols. Timer starts with first click of the user.

Dependencies.

- Internet connection is required for symbols to appear and for jQuery to be in effect.

Thanks and have fun.
